It's been __years__ since I've published my own blog. So far I've done a __few things__ but I've got a ways to go.

1. Forked a github repo that uses [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/ "Eleventy (11ty)"), a static site generator
2. Set up [Atom](https://atom.io/ "Atom.io") + [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/ "GitHub desktop ") (Because I like simply designed software)
3. Deploying via [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/start-with-a-template/)
4. Replaced my Squarespace one pager and redirected all of this to adellecharles.com
5. Writing this thing in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ "MD")
6. Thinking about a lot of ideas, so I've written a bunch of drafts for my first few articles in [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/).
7. More TK.
