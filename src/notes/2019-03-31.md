It's been __years__ since I've published my own blog. So far I've done a __few things__ but I've got a ways to go.

* Forked a github repo that uses Eleventy, a static site generator / [11ty](https://www.11ty.io/)
* Set up Atom & Github Desktop (Because I like visual things)
* Deploying via Netlify / [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/start-with-a-template/)
* Replaced my Squarespace one pager and redirected all of this to adellecharles.com
* Writing this thing in Markdown / [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ "MD")
* Thinking about a lot of drafts for my first few article ideas...
* More TK.
